## Game Name
Shark Evolution by Steven Etgen & Michael Ly

## Blurb
Our game gives the players complete control over the evolution of their character, a shark, while introducing simple coding practices which give players a clear sense of how methods and attributes are used in programming. The player can move in different directions and the goal is to consume enough fish to start using provided methods to change the attributes of their character (shark). We intend to create an enjoyable experience for the players so that they can be constantly engaged in the gameplay while learning how to do basic coding. After playing our game, players will be able to correctly use simple coding methods when they are in future computer science classes.

## Basic Instructions
You can move the shark anywhere on the screen using the arrow keys on your keyboard, eat fish that are smaller than your shark and avoid fish that are bigger than it. Your total score should increase if you eat smaller fish and decrease if you eat bigger fish. If you gain enough points, upgrade your shark by calling methods. You can either make your shark faster or bigger. The end goal is to get enough points to beat the game.
