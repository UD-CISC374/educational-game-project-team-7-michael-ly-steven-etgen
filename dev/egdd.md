===========================


Elevator Pitch
--------------

A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check[  this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.

Our game gives the player complete control over the evolution of their character, a shark, while introducing simple coding practices which give players a clear sense of how methods and attributes are used in programming.


Influences (Brief)
------------------

-   Influence #1: Feeding Frenzy

-   Medium: Video game

-   Explanation: This is a simple yet addicting game where you start with a relatively small fish. Your fish can get bigger in size by eating enough fish that are  smaller than it. As your fish gets bigger, it can start targeting fish that used to be bigger than it. This game has a similar style to Feeding Frenzy. We use a similar concept with our game as you gain the ability to call methods as you eat fish of smaller size.


Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)
-------------------------------

Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics

-   *Gameplay Mechanic #1: Eat fish of a smaller size to gain the ability to call methods that change your shark.

-   *Gameplay Mechanic #2: Input a method that grows your shark.

-   *Gameplay Mechanic #3: Input a method that changes your shark's speed.

-   *Gameplay Mechanic #4: Input a method that changes your shark's color and other physical attributes (color, shape, etc.)

-   *Gameplay Mechanic #5: Move the shark by pressing and holding the arrow keys


Learning Aspects
================

-   Learn simple coding practices such as method calls and how attributes work

-   Learn that some methods require specific inputs to be called correctly


Learning Domains
----------------

Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.

-   Coding/Programming (method calls, attributes, etc.)

-   Simple debugging (Getting instructions on when a method was called incorrectly and why)


Target Audiences
----------------

Who are your learners?

-   Middle and high school students with an interest in learning simple coding practices


Target Contexts
---------------

Describe what kinds of formal and informal learning contexts this will be used in (e.g., courses, k-12 computer labs during free time).

-   Introduction to programming classes (5, 6, 7, grade or older, novice programmers)

-   Informal free time for students that want to learn some simple coding practices


Learning Objectives
-------------------

Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.

-   Correctly call methods: By the end of the game, players will be able to call methods correctly by passing in inputs the right way.

-   Identify attributes: By the end of the game, players will be able to identify attributes from an object.

-   Change attributes: By the end of the game, players will be able to change attributes of an object through calling methods.


Prerequisite Knowledge
----------------------

What do they need to know prior to trying this game?

-   Prior to the game, players need to be able to understand the concept of a function (the fact that calling a function changes an attribute)

-   Prior to the game, players need to be able to read directions and follow basic instructions


Assessment Measures
-------------------

Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.

If proposing a new instrument, briefly and concisely list some example assessment questions.

-   Given a function declaration, call the function correctly.

-   Given a list of attributes, modify the attributes through calling methods correctly.


What sets this project apart?
=============================

Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.

-   Gives the player complete control (to an extent) over how the shark grows and changes throughout the game. This teaches simple method calls and other basic programming knowledge at the same time.

-   Gives the player an addicting game with a simple objective, while letting them customize their shark's appearance and other physical attributes. This will let them be creative and build a unique gaming experience, all while teaching them programming fundamentals.


Player Interaction Patterns and Modes
=====================================


Player Interaction Pattern
--------------------------

Describe how people play your game, how many players are involved at once, how they interact with the system works, etc.

This game is for one person, they use a keyboard to take control of the game character, the shark, which includes moving the shark as well as modifying the attributes of the shark. The player will call methods that appear in a box, changing the shark's size, shape and color. They then will have to eat more fish before unlocking the ability to call new methods, or the same method again.


Player Modes
------------

Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.

-   Title Screen: This is the title screen of the game where players can choose to start their playthrough. The title screen will transition to the main game when the player clicks the start button.

-   Main Game: Classic mode is the base mode of the game. The player works to grow his shark through the use of methods and attributes. The player will be able to transition to a menu screen by clicking the menu button at the top of the game.

-   Menu Screen: The player will be able to access transition back to the main game or the title screen by clicking the appropriate button in the menu screen.


Gameplay Objectives
===================

-   Evolve your shark through method calls:

-   Description: Control your shark and change other aspects of yourself by calling methods with the appropriate inputs.

-   Alignment: Gives the player the ability to directly control the shark's appearance through the calling of methods. The player will see the exact changes that they are making through simple coding practices.

-   Primary Objective #2: Dominate the Ocean

-   Description: Eat fish to gain access to gain points. After a certain number of points, the player will gain access to new methods and the ability to call old methods again. As the shark grows, the player will be able to consume every fish in the ocean.

-   Alignment: This gives the player creative control over how they call each method and what attributes they want to upgrade first. The player will be able to use the power of method calls to play the game however they like. Eventually, they will grow strong enough to eat anything they wish in the ocean.


Procedures/Actions
==================

Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.

-   You can move the shark across the screen and eat smaller fish.

-   You can use methods to modify your shark after eating a certain number of fish 


Rules
=====

What resources are available to the player that they make use of? How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?

-   If the shark eats fish smaller than it, points will be rewarded.

-   If the shark attempts to eat fish bigger than it, the player is penalized by decreasing the total number of points. Eventually the player might lose enough points to die and lose the game

-   There are a certain number of fish of each size that the player can eat. AS the shark grows, eating fish that are very small give less points and are therefore not worth going after

-   The player will use the points they gain to unlock the ability to call methods that change their shark's color, size, and shape

-   Eventually they will be big enough to eat everything in the ocean

-   Resources for calling the methods correctly will be available to ensure players can correctly understand how method calling work


Objects/Entities
================

What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.

-   There is a shark with a variable size, color, and shape.

-   There are fish with variable size, along with other sharks, and even a giant squid and megalodon near the ocean floor.

-   There is a score at the top of the screen.

-   There is a menu button that allows the player to return to the title screen and see a record of how they have upgraded their shark.


Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)
----------------------------------

-   Control your shark: You can move the shark anywhere on the screen using the arrow keys on your keyboard, eat fish that are smaller than your shark and avoid fish that are bigger than it. Your total score should increase if you eat smaller fish and decrease if you eat bigger fish.

-   Upgrade your shark: If you gain enough points, upgrade your shark by calling methods. You can either make your shark faster or bigger. The end goal is to get enough points to beat the game.


Feedback
--------

Explicitly describe what visual/audio/animation indicators there are that give players feedback on their progress towards their gameplay objectives (and ideally the learning objectives).

Describe what longer-term feedback you detect and give that guides the player in their learning and lets them know how they are doing in regards to the learning objectives.

-   If you eat fish that are smaller than the shark, your total score will go up, which will be presented at the top of the screen.

-   If you eat fish that are bigger than the shark, your total score decreases and if it lowers enough, it's game over.

-   Gaining enough points to will allow you to call a method, which has instructions on how it is called

-   Calling the method correctly gives positive feedback and an audio cue, while calling it incorrectly results in a prompt to try again

-   Eventually the instructions will tell the player exactly what to write to call the method properly, if they get it wrong a certain number of times


Story and Gameplay
==================


Presentation of Rules
---------------------

Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly. 

-   The player will begin the game with control of the shark, and rules will appear simply. For example, the first rule given will be to eat a smaller fish. When that task is completed, the next objective will be displayed to the player and will let them call a simple method that increases their shark size, by typing the method call into a text box. As the player eats more fish and calls more methods, different instructions will appear that describe how to properly call each method. In this way the instructions will appear when needed, and will not overwhelm the player.


Presentation of Content
-----------------------

Briefly describe how the player will be taught the core material they are meant to learn. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching material iteratively and slowly.

The player will immediately be dropped into the ocean, gaining control of a small, plain shark. The rules will now appear, prompting the player to start eating fish. After eating a sufficient amount of fish, the player will be able to call their first method, increasing shark size. The player will then be told to eat more fish, which in turn will introduce other method calls available. After this phase of instruction leading the player, they will be able to eat more fish and call the given methods after eating a certain amount, giving them creative control over how they build their shark. A final warning will be given to avoid the ocean depths, as larger sharks and other beasts lurk down there. Eventually the player will travel deeper as they grow, and will be able to eat everything in the ocean.


Story (Brief)
-------------

The Summary or TL;DR version of below 

Our shark begins small and plain, and as the player progresses through the game he can grow and become larger. Eventually, he will overcome the dangerous obstacles of the sea to become an apex predator, even getting large enough to eat giant squid and other large sharks.


Storyboarding
-------------

Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game. You are strongly recommended to sketch pictures on paper and embed them here. Be sure make it clear how previously-described mechanics come through in the dynamics.
